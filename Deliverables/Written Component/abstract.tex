Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a special case of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) that allow for effective time-series forecasting by making use of cell states and memory cells to incorporate past time point's information when predicting future values. These methods provide several benefits over traditional methods such as ARIMA models. This presentation explores the introductory results obtained from training and predicting on hydrology data collected within the Everglades National Park.
