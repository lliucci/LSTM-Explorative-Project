Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a special case of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) that allow for past information to be used for informed predictions. LSTMs solve a number of issues that arise in the fitting process of classical RNNs. Like all deep learning models, LSTMs require massive continuous time series to be trained properly. For this paper, data collected within the Everglades National Park were used as they met the criteria for appropriate training and testing data. In this paper, LSTMs are explained and compared to traditional time series forecasting models such as ARIMA and Holt-Winters models.
