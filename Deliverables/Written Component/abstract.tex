Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a special case of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) that allow for past information to make informed predictions. LSTMs are able to do this without the exploding/vanishing gradient problem that can occur with RNNs. The data used were collected within the Everglades National Park as water depth time series. In this paper, a comparison of LSTMs is made to other methods such as ARIMA models and Holt-Winters models.
