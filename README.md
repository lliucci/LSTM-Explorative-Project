# Writing Project Proposal 

The focus of my writing project will be on applications of machine learning techniques for time series forecasting. As of now, I have not found a single technique to focus on, so I will likely cover several techniques and compare. Pablo Ruiz covered a short summary of several techniques in his article "ML Approached for Time Series", where he introduced techniques such as Symbol Regression, Extreme Learning Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks [@ruiz2019machinelearning]. Akusok et al covers a deep dive into Extreme Learning Machines and how to properly utilize them [@akusok2015high]. Specific applications of Machine Learning for Time Series forecasting is covered in Lim et al, where the algorithms and model forms are described [@lim2021time]. Lim et al also covers different decoder architectures that can be used to account for temporal data. As my GRA is based on time series clustering, I will attempt to use time series data from 2000 to 2020 and attempt to forecast up to 2023 for cross validation. Observed data from 2020 to 2023 will allow for proper assessment of prediction ability of each method. As there are missing values within the data proposed to be used, Machine Learning methods for imputation may also be explored.
